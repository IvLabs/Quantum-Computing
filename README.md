# Quantum Machine Learning

This repository, is intended to serve as a collection of different algorithms, structures and feature maps used for Quantum Machine Learning.

The following papers (at least the circuits) have been implemented:\
- [x] [Expressibility and entangling capability of parameterized quantum circuits for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10876)
