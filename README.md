# Quantum Machine Learning

Quantum machine learning is a nascent but emerging field which couples not only the state of the art paradigms of information theory (i.e. Machine Learning) but also the unprecedented computational advantages of quantum algorithms and quantum information. Below is a visual representation of cross-play between the areas of research.

This repository, is intended to serve as a collection of different algorithms, structures and feature maps used for Quantum Machine Learning.

The following papers (at least the circuits) have been implemented:
- [x] [Expressibility and entangling capability of parameterized quantum circuits for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms](expressibility_and_entangling/)
