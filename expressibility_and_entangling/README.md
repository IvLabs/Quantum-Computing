# Quantum Machine Learning

This section contains all the circuit implementations from the paper on "[Expressibility and entangling capability of parameterized quantum circuits for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10876).

The paper provides an elementary yet useful set of feature maps that one can explore, while trying to build a classification circuit, or rather, any circuit which requires the use of a feature map. These feature maps can be coupled with variational circuits, to find the best match for the task at hand.

Further experimentation and an implementation of a complete Variational Quantum Classifier can be found [here](https://github.com/GlazeDonuts/Variational-Quantum-Classifier).
